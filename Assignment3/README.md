IMPORTANT!!!
Before using the make command, there must be a newline after the last line of fat32.h file, i have edited my version of fat32.h to include this newline but if you are using a new fat32.h file, then you would have to put in that new line after the last line(#endif) by pressing "enter".

after using make command, run my program as "./fat32 ~comp3430/shared/a3_files/3430-good.img info" for part1, 
"./fat32 ~comp3430/shared/a3_files/3430-good.img list" for part2 
and "./fat32 ~comp3430/shared/a3_files/3430-good.img get BOOKS/WARAND~1.TXT" for part3
