### Adding my resume to my repository

Your resume should be formatted in markdown which is a lightweight markup language which makes it easier to host your documentation online. Andrew Etter highlights the importance of using a Lightweight markup language to host a site on Github pages in his book and recommends Github Flavoured Markdown as a fine choice for a Markdown "flavour".

### Formatting my Github pages site using jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator with built-in support for Github Pages. Jekyll gives you a lot of flexibility to customize how it builds your site. These options can either be specified in a _config.yml or _config.toml file placed in your siteâ€™s root directory, or can be specified as flags for the jekyll executable in the terminal. Andrew Etter recommends Jekyll as a tool to create a beautiful, functional documentation website in his book. These steps will guide you on how to apply jekyll configurations to your Github Pages site.

1. Add some formatting by clicking on "add file" on the home page.
2. Select "create a new file" from the drop down list.
3. Enter "_config.yml" as the name of the file.
4. Add the formatting you want to the file, a link to various formatting options is included under more resources.
5. Commit the file after adding your formatting.
6. Wait for up to 10 minutes for your changes to get applied to your resume.

RESULT: Your formatting has been added to your hosted resume page.

### Creating a README file
Andrew Etter recommends creating a "README.md" file in the root of the repository for the purpose of giving a quick summary of what you are hosting, instructions on how to build the documentation locally and instructions on how to contribute to it.

1. Click on "add file" on the home page.
2. Select "create a new file" from the drop down list.
3. Enter "README.md" as the name of the file.
4. Enter the information you would like to be in the readme.
5. Commit the file.

RESULT: Your README.md file contents will be displayed on the homepage of your repository.

## FAQs
1. "Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?"  
Markdown is a better than a word processor because it is easier to learn how to use, it is also easier to convert Markdown to HTML unlike MS Word. Overall, it is a better and more effective tool for text that will be published online. 

2. "Why is my resume not showing up?"  
Your resume could not show up because your resume is not in the root directory of your repository or your resume is not named properly for it to be recognized. Also your resume could not be showing because your github pages settings is not building from the correct source and branch.
